# Dolphin Blue Paradise — Presentation Script

Use this outline as a guide while presenting the fullscreen deck (`presentation.html`). Each section aligns with the slide numbers shown onscreen.

## Slide 1 · Opening
- Welcome and reframe Dolphin Blue Paradise’s relaunch as an opportunity to own direct demand.
- Set expectations: end-to-end plan covering research, stack, comms, and go-live.
- Highlight the human + AI collaboration angle right away.

## Slide 2 · Target Intent
- Emphasise that we start with traveller intent, not just keywords.
- Call out the priority feeder markets (Miami, NYC, Toronto, CDMX, Bogotá) and their flight convenience.
- Note the guest segments we’re prioritising: adventure couples, eco-minded families, remote professionals.
- Mention seasonality overlays and how they influence editorial focus.

## Slide 3 · SERP Intelligence
- Explain the automated pipeline: Google Custom Search + Search Console APIs pulling the top five results for every keyword cluster.
- Describe what we record from each page (metadata, heading structure, schema, media usage).
- Share early insights: Bambuda/Nayara leading with rich media; Sol Bungalows winning with storytelling; Central Hotel indexing strongly for city breaks.

## Slide 4 · Notebook LM Blueprint
- Outline how we feed Notebook LM with the SERP exports, competitor pages, and the existing Wix content.
- Stress that the AI returns patterns we can action: tone, narrative structure, schema gaps.
- Connect this to the deliverable—an SEO + AI optimised sitemap, copy briefs, and asset requirements.
- Flag that this process gives us content priorities before design begins.

## Slide 5 · Visual Benchmark
- Walk through the side-by-side visuals: current Wix experience vs Bambuda and Sol Bungalows.
- Point out the gaps: hero storytelling, clarity of CTAs, and social proof placement.
- Explain that these comparisons translate directly into our requirements list (longer-form story, immersive media, conversion-focused layout).

## Slide 6 · Platform Ownership
- Introduce Railway as the unified hosting environment for the marketing site, CRM, and automation agents.
- Highlight benefits: performance, backups, single billing, and data ownership.
- Mention that EspoCRM and any auxiliary services (invoice agent, future tools) sit within the same controlled stack.

## Slide 7 · Funnel Design
- Detail how dynamic CTAs, journey-aware pop-ups, and itinerary builders convert visits to qualified leads.
- Show the human + AI handoff: real-time coverage 9am–6pm panama time, automations at night.
- Reinforce that every interaction is captured in EspoCRM for follow-up and attribution.

## Slide 8 · Communications Layer
- Describe the 3CX rollout: US number, Panama number, and up to 10 extensions at no licence cost.
- Connect phone, WhatsApp, and website click-to-call within the same PBX.
- Emphasise CRM integration: call logs, recordings, and profiles for quicker closing.

## Slide 9 · Timeline
- Present the phased schedule from October 15 to launch on November 15.
- Clarify that we front-load research and sitemap, then development, testing, and launch.
- Note dependencies: image sourcing, copy approvals, and PBX configuration.

## Slide 10 · Kickoff Requirements
- Summarise the minimal inputs needed to start: project email, media library, brand voice examples.
- Ask for confirmation on keyword priorities and the Railway + EspoCRM consolidation.
- Invite any design inspiration to calibrate aesthetics before wireframing.

## Closing Prompt (post-slide)
- Offer to schedule the Notebook LM insight session for the week of October 21.
