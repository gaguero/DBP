1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The hotel is built on a mangrove island, which is very different from a solid land island.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The terrain here is acidic, salty, and unstable, making work difficult.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
When we arrived, many areas were still flooded, especially during the rainy season.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
In the first phase of construction, all the land was redistributed to raise the ground level and prevent future flooding.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This land was also used to elevate the pathways and create various secret gardens.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
To stabilize the land, a large amount of gravel and sand was needed.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
From there, the access points were defined and the areas intended for gardens were marked.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
With the goal of gaining more land, we decided to create a natural lake,

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
digging up to 2.5 meters deep with a team of 20 people and two extraction pumps running all day.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Since the amount of land was still insufficient, I proposed creating a river that could become a new attraction in the future.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Everything must be brought from the main island and transported by boat.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Everything is unloaded by hand because we cannot use machinery.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We also faced the presence of chytras, which we fought with a special treatment exclusive to Nayara.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Once the land was stabilized, we began testing with plants.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Many species didn't adapt, but after research, we developed a suitable list.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Having mastered this phase, I implemented a propagation system using mother plants.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Today, 75% of the plants come from our own nursery.

18
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Vision. To be the most exclusive and sustainable luxury destination in the Caribbean.

19
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:38,000
