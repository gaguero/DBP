# Dolphin Blue Paradise Website Redesign

## DBP Snapshot
- Project codename: **DBP** (Dolphin Blue Paradise).

## Project Overview
- Build a new, visually refined website for Dolphin Blue Paradise using content from the scraped legacy Wix site.
- Source snapshot (captured 2025-09-20) lives in `dolphinblueparadis-1/d/` and includes HTML, JSON, plain-text extracts, and screen captures.
- Deliverable: consolidated content inventory and media references to guide upcoming UX, design, copy editing, and localization work.
- Languages: English primary with Spanish mirrors (`hogar`, `habitaciones`, `instalaciones`, `menus`, `spanish-activity-brochure`).

## Experience Goals & Constraints
- Preserve core messaging around eco-luxury, personalization, sustainability, and community impact.
- Modernize hierarchy and visual storytelling while improving accessibility (legible typography, alt text, encoded characters).
- Centralize booking funnels (Book Now CTA, WhatsApp, email) and clarify travel logistics.
- Highlight differentiators: off-grid operations, farm-to-table dining, curated excursions, partnerships with local communities.

### Activity Brochures (`www.dolphinblueparadise.com-activity-brochure.html` and variants)

### Reservation (`www.dolphinblueparadise.com-reservation.html`)
- Placeholder reiterating "Our Rooms" plus contact details; integrate with final booking mechanism or replace with embedded form.

### Spanish Pages
- `www.dolphinblueparadise.com-hogar.html`, `-habitaciones.html`, `-instalaciones.html`, `-menus.html`, `-spanish-activity-brochure.html` mirror English content for ES audience.
- Determine localization workflow (single CMS entries with translations vs. separate page variants).

### Duplicates & Artifacts
- `copy-of-home` and `copy-of-activity-brochure` duplicates of English pages; treat as archival references only.
- Extracted text (`*.txt` files) contains encoding artifacts (smart quotes, emojis, special icons); normalize copy during content editing.

## Media Library
- 75 unique remote assets hosted on static.wixstatic.com (hero imagery, galleries, icons, scanned menus, brochures).ds
- Use the `media-gallery.html` template to preview all assets; download and host via the new stack before launch.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Clean and proofread all copy (resolve encoding glitches, confirm measurements, update legal attributions).
2. Expand activity and menu descriptions into accessible text; pair with booking CTAs or inquiry forms.
3. Define booking flow (embedded engine vs. external link) and unify CTAs across pages.
4. Audit imagery for quality and aspect ratio; plan CDN migration and alt text.
5. Establish bilingual content process (translation management, routing of inquiries by language).
6. Validate travel logistics, pricing references, and donation list with the Dolphin Blue Paradise team before publishing.
