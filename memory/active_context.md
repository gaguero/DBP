# Active Context

Use this file to capture the immediate objectives and guardrails for the current coding session.
Update it whenever the focus shifts so the assistant can reload the right context quickly.

- **Current Focus**: Close remaining Stage 0 discovery checklist so planning and content work can start with no gaps.
- **Entry Point**:
  - `PROJECT-ROADMAP.md` → Section 6 “Outstanding Information Checklist”.
  - `docs/presentation-script.md` & `docs/presentation.html` → kickoff requirements alignment.
  - Stakeholder notes (pending) for booking engine specs, consent tool, multilingual ops.
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Each item in discovery checklist has owner, status, and storage location (link/doc).
  - Decision log recorded in `memory/progress.md` and summarized in `memory/tasks.md`.
  - Any blockers or dependencies labeled and scheduled for follow-up.
- **Notes & Constraints**:
  - Depend on external confirmations for booking widget documentation, Railway service provisioning, and consent solution.
  - Launch timeline targets Nov 15; discovery must wrap before Stage 1 content prep begins.
  - Maintain bilingual considerations when documenting processes (site, Chatwoot, EspoCRM templates).
- **Next Review**: Reassess after discovery tracker is 100% accounted for or by 2025-10-17 EOD, whichever comes first.

> Keep this lean. Archive longer notes or resolved thoughts in `progress.md` once they are no longer critical to the live context.
