Chronological snapshot of decisions, experiments, and outcomes. Add a new entry whenever meaningful progress occurs.

## 2025-10-16
- **Focus**: Stage 0 discovery alignment (`S0-001` → `S0-006`).
- **Actions**: Reviewed roadmap, presentation script/deck, style guide, sitemap, EspoCRM setup notes; populated product context, active focus, task ledger; mapped outstanding discovery items and downstream stage gates.
- **Results / Follow-ups**: Discovery tasks now tracked with owners/status; planning blocked on booking widget specs (`S0-001`) and multilingual comms plan (`S0-003`); need external confirmations before promoting `S2-001`.

## 2025-10-15
- **Focus**: Newsletter → EspoCRM lead flow.
- **Actions**: Updated the web signup endpoint to create EspoCRM leads and added a retry fallback that drops the optional phone number when Espo validation rejects the format.
- **Results / Follow-ups**: Newsletter signups succeed regardless of phone input; future builds should preserve the retry safeguard.
